# Cresendo-The-Anger-Within
This is a Python-based shooter game where your aim is to defend your queen from a zombie. There are some errors (mainly the score system is broken), but I will hopefully find a fix for it.

NOTE: To run the game, download the folder 'Cresendo The Anger Within' and run it in your preferred IDE (I use Visual Studio Code, but that  is my preference). Ensure that all libraries (PyGame for example) are installed and have fun playing.

Kind regards,
Adam Wareshallee
